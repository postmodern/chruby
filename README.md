# chruby

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/postmodern/chruby.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/postmodern/chruby)

Changes the current Ruby.

## Features

* Updates `$PATH`.
  * Also adds RubyGems `bin/` directories to `$PATH`.
* Correctly sets `$GEM_HOME` and `$GEM_PATH`.
  * Users: gems are installed into `~/.gem/$ruby/$version`.
  * Root: gems are installed directly into `/path/to/$ruby/$gemdir`.
* Additionally sets `$RUBY_ROOT`, `$RUBY_ENGINE`, `$RUBY_VERSION` and
  `$GEM_ROOT`.
* Optionally sets `$RUBYOPT` if second argument is given.
* Calls `hash -r` to clear the command-lookup hash-table.
* Fuzzy matching of Rubies by name.
* Defaults to the system Ruby.
* Optionally supports auto-switching and the `.ruby-version` file.
* Supports [bash] and [zsh].
* Small (~100 LOC).
* Has tests.

## Anti-Features

* Does not hook `cd`.
* Does not install executable shims (avoids ~50ms overhead).
* Does not require Rubies be installed into your home directory.
* Does not automatically switch Rubies by default.
* Does not require write-access to the Ruby directory in order to install gems.

## Requirements

* [bash] >= 3 or [zsh]

## Install

    wget -O chruby-0.3.9.tar.gz https://github.com/postmodern/chruby/archive/v0.3.9.tar.gz
    tar -xzvf chruby-0.3.9.tar.gz
    cd chruby-0.3.9/
    sudo make install

### PGP

All releases are [PGP] signed for security. Instructions on how to import my
PGP key can be found on my [blog][1]. To verify that a release was not tampered 
with:

    wget https://raw.github.com/postmodern/chruby/master/pkg/chruby-0.3.9.tar.gz.asc
    gpg --verify chruby-0.3.9.tar.gz.asc chruby-0.3.9.tar.gz

### setup.sh

chruby also includes a `setup.sh` script, which installs chruby. Simply run the 
script as root or via `sudo`:

    sudo ./scripts/setup.sh

### Homebrew

chruby can also be installed with [homebrew]:

    brew install chruby

Or the absolute latest chruby can be installed from source:

    brew install chruby --HEAD

### Arch Linux

chruby is already included in the [AUR]:

    yaourt -S chruby

### Fedora Linux

chruby is available as an rpm on [Fedora Copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/postmodern/chruby/).
    
### FreeBSD

chruby is included in the official [FreeBSD ports collection]:

    cd /usr/ports/devel/chruby/ && make install clean

### Rubies

#### Manually

Chruby provides detailed instructions for installing additional Rubies:

* [Ruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby/wiki/Ruby)
* [JRuby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby/wiki/JRuby)
* [Rubinius](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby/wiki/Rubinius)
* [MagLev](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby/wiki/MagLev)

#### ruby-install

You can also use [ruby-install] to install additional Rubies:

Installing to `/opt/rubies` or `~/.rubies`:

    ruby-install ruby
    ruby-install jruby
    ruby-install rubinius
    ruby-install maglev

#### ruby-build

You can also use [ruby-build] to install additional Rubies:

Installing to `/opt/rubies`:

    ruby-build 1.9.3-p392 /opt/rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p392
    ruby-build jruby-1.7.3 /opt/rubies/jruby-1.7.3
    ruby-build rbx-2.0.0-rc1 /opt/rubies/rubinius-2.0.0-rc1
    ruby-build maglev-1.0.0 /opt/rubies/maglev-1.0.0

## Configuration

Add the following to the `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file:

``` bash
source /usr/local/share/chruby/chruby.sh
```

*Note:* OSX does not automatically execute `~/.bashrc`, instead try adding to `/etc/bashrc`.

### System Wide

If you wish to enable chruby system-wide, add the following to
`/etc/profile.d/chruby.sh`:

``` bash
if [ -n "$BASH_VERSION" ] || [ -n "$ZSH_VERSION" ]; then
  source /usr/local/share/chruby/chruby.sh
  ...
fi
```

This will prevent chruby from accidentally being loaded by `/bin/sh`, which
is not always the same as `/bin/bash`.

### Rubies

When chruby is first loaded by the shell, it will auto-detect Rubies installed
in `/opt/rubies/` and `~/.rubies/`. After installing new Rubies, you _must_
restart the shell before chruby can recognize them.

For Rubies installed in non-standard locations, simply append their paths to
the `RUBIES` variable:

``` bash
source /usr/local/share/chruby/chruby.sh

RUBIES+=(
  /opt/jruby-1.7.0
  "$HOME/src/rubinius"
)
```

### Migrating

If you are migrating from another Ruby manager, set `RUBIES` accordingly:

#### RVM

``` bash
RUBIES+=(~/.rvm/rubies/*)
```

#### rbenv

``` bash
RUBIES+=(~/.rbenv/versions/*)
```

#### rbfu

``` bash
RUBIES+=(~/.rbfu/rubies/*)
```

### Auto-Switching

If you want chruby to auto-switch the current version of Ruby when you `cd`
between your different projects, simply load `auto.sh` in `~/.bashrc` or
`~/.zshrc`:

``` bash
source /usr/local/share/chruby/chruby.sh
source /usr/local/share/chruby/auto.sh
```

*Note:* OSX does not automatically execute `~/.bashrc`, instead try adding to `/etc/bashrc`.

chruby will check the current and parent directories for a [.ruby-version]
file. Other Ruby switchers also understand this file:
https://gist.github.com/1912050

If you want to automatically run the version of a gem executable specified in 
your project's Gemfile, try 
[rubygems-bundler](https://github.com/mpapis/rubygems-bundler).

### Default Ruby

Once you have loaded `chruby.sh` and/or `auto.sh` in your shell configuration,
you can also set a default Ruby. Simply call the `chruby` function in
`~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zprofile`:

    chruby ruby-1.9

If you have enabled auto-switching, simply create a `.ruby-version` file:

    echo "ruby-1.9" > ~/.ruby-version

### RubyGems

Gems installed as a non-root user via `gem install` will be installed into
`~/.gem/$ruby/X.Y.Z`.  By default, RubyGems will use the absolute path to the
currently selected ruby for the shebang of any binstubs it generates.  In some
cases, this path may contain extra version information (e.g.
`ruby-2.0.0-p451`).  To mitigate potential problems when removing rubies, you
can force RubyGems to generate binstubs with shebangs that will search for
ruby in your `$PATH` by using `gem install --env-shebang` (or the equivalent
short option `-E`).  This parameter can also be added to your gemrc file.
