## Code Style

* 2-space indent code.
* Keep code within 80 columns.
* Use the `function` keyword for functions.
* Use printf instead of echo.
* Quote all String variables.
* Variables which do not belong in the environment must not be upper-case.
* Prefer single-line expressions where appropriate:

  [[ -n "$foo" ]] && other command

  if   [[ "$foo" == "bar" ]]; then command
  elif [[ "$foo" == "baz" ]]; then other_command
  fi

  case "$foo" in
    bar) command ;;
    baz) other_command ;;
  esac

## Pull Request Guidelines

* Additional features should go in separate files within `share/chruby/`.
* All new code must have [shunit2] unit-tests.
* If a feature is out of scope or does more than switches Rubies,
  it should become its own project. Simply copy the generic [Makefile]
  for shell script projects.

### What Will Not Be Accepted

* Completion: tab completion is not necessary for fuzzy matching
  (ex: `chruby 1.9`).
* Gemset functionality: there is already [chgems] and others, which provides
  gemset like behavior.
* Sub-commands: this tends to promote bloat. It was first popularized by [RVM]
  and then copied by [rbenv].
* [Bash][bash] or [Zsh][zsh] only features: chruby must fully support both
  [bash] and [zsh].
* New `.files`: we should strive to prevent dotfile proliferation, and instead
  support common dotfiles which other Ruby Switchers could support.
* New environment variables: much like with dotfile proliferation,
  we should keep environment variable pollution to a minimum.
* Ruby/OS specific workarounds: we should not tolerate the existence of bugs
  in specific Rubies or Operating Systems. Instead we should strive to resolve
  these bugs, to the benefit of all users.
* Any [RVM]/[rbenv] specific feature: we should not blindly copy the features of
  [RVM] or [rbenv] in the hopes of making new users comfortable. Instead,
  we should question these features and rethink (or unthink) them.
  * Are some of these features even necessary?
  * Could they be implemented differently?
  * Do they over-optimize rarely performed tasks?
  * Do they make assumptions about workflow?
  * Do they add additional complexity?
  * Do they introduce possible Security risks?
